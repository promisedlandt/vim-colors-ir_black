## Description

This is a Vim version of the IR_Black color scheme, created by Todd Werth, although the original blog post has fallen to bit rot.  
I have modified it slightly.

## Features

- High contrast, works very well with my red/green colourblindness
- Low contrast for things you don't always want to notice (current line, line numbers other than current line)
- Search results are underlined, not coloured
- Includes a few custom highlight groups for Ruby

## Installation

Install it like any other plugin, then add the following to your config file:

```
syntax enable " syntax highlighting
colorscheme ir_black
```
